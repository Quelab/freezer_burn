## Concept
This project aims to reduce freezer burn in the following two ways:

1. Alert when food improperly stored in the freezer.
2. Only use the defrost cycle when required.

Accomplishing those two goals is all about sensing the environment inside of the freezer compartment and the refrigerator provided by FirstBuild seems to provide the framework to do this.
